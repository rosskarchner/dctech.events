## Iteration 1 - Create Categories Directory Structure (Phase 1.1)
- Created _categories/ directory
- Added 16 category YAML files (python, ai, gaming, cybersecurity, data, coworking, ux-design, microsoft, cloud, linux, crypto, startups, social, vendor-conferences, conferences, training)
- Each file contains name and description fields as per PRD template
- Files changed: 16 new files in _categories/

Learnings for future iterations:
- Category files follow simple YAML structure with name and description
- All 16 files created match the specification in PRD.md Phase 1.1
- Tests failed due to missing Python dependencies (markupsafe, dateutil, yaml) - not related to this change
- The _categories/ directory is now ready for Phase 1.2 (get_categories() function)
- Next task should be implementing get_categories() function in app.py

---

## Iteration 2 - Add get_categories() Function (Phase 1.2)
- Implemented get_categories() function in app.py
- Function loads all YAML files from _categories/ directory
- Returns dict mapping slugs to category metadata: {'python': {'name': '...', 'description': '...', 'slug': 'python'}, ...}
- Added categories to context processor so available in all templates
- Files changed: app.py

Learnings for future iterations:
- Followed same pattern as get_approved_groups() function
- Categories dict is keyed by slug (filename without extension) for easy lookup
- Each category includes name, description, and slug fields
- Context processor now provides 'categories' variable to all templates
- All 18 tests passed successfully
- Function successfully loads all 16 categories
- Next task: Phase 1.3 - Add suppress_guid feature

---

## Iteration 3 - Update Data Loading Pipeline (Phase 1.4)
- Implemented category resolution in generate_month_data.py
- Added CATEGORIES_DIR constant for _categories directory
- Created load_categories() function to load all category YAML files
- Created resolve_event_categories() function with priority logic:
  1. Event-specific categories take priority
  2. Falls back to group categories if event doesn't specify
  3. Returns empty list if neither has categories
- Updated generate_yaml() to load categories at start of build
- Added category resolution for iCal events (resolves from event or group)
- Added category resolution for single events (resolves from event or group, looks up group by name)
- Categories are now stored in upcoming.yaml event data
- Files changed: generate_month_data.py

Learnings for future iterations:
- Phase 1.3 (suppress_guid) was already implemented in commit 813669c
- Category resolution happens during the build process, not at request time
- Single events can reference groups by name, so we need to look up the group object
- Category inheritance follows the priority: event > group > none
- Categories are validated against loaded category definitions
- All 18 tests pass successfully
- Tested category inheritance by temporarily adding categories to a group
- Next task: Phase 2.1 - Create Category Page Template

---

## Iteration 4 - Create Category Page Template (Phase 2.1)
- Created templates/category_page.html based on location_page.html structure
- Template extends base.html and includes standard layout
- Displays category name as page title
- Shows category description when available
- Displays count of upcoming events with proper pluralization
- Includes partials/events_by_day.html for event listings
- Shows empty state when no events found (with links to home and add event pages)
- Added Open Graph meta tags for social sharing (og:title, og:type, og:description, og:site_name)
- Files changed: templates/category_page.html (new file)

Learnings for future iterations:
- Category page template mirrors location_page.html with variable name changes
- Template is ready but needs corresponding route in app.py (Phase 2.2) to be functional
- All 79 tests pass successfully after adding template
- Template uses same partials as other listing pages for consistency
- Empty state provides helpful navigation back to main site or submission form
- Next task: Phase 2.2 - Add Category Page Route
