name: Run Tests

# This workflow uses pull_request_target instead of pull_request to allow tests to run
# without approval for the repository owner's own PRs. For security:
# 1. The workflow only runs automatically for OWNER, MEMBER, and COLLABORATOR
# 2. External contributors will still require manual approval before tests run
# 3. PR code is explicitly checked out (not the base branch) to test the actual changes
